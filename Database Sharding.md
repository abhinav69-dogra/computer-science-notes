## MongoDB Introduction

- A record in MongoDB is a document (data structure composed of key-value pairs). MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects.

- Values of fields can include other documents, arrays or arrays of documents.

- MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.

## Advantages of using documents

- Documents (objects) correspond to native data types in many languages.

- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.

## Key Features

- MongoDB provides high performance. Embedded data models reduce I/O activity on database system. Indexes support faster queries.

- Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of the collectionâ€™s data set in an easy to traverse form. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field.

- MongoDB has high availability. The replication facility called replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set providing redundancy and increasing data availability.

- MongoDB provides horizontal scalabiility as a core functionality.
