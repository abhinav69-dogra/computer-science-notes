## Advantages

- Insertion and retrievals are easier in NoSQL database as all data is present in 1 JSON document. In SQL, joins across tables can be expensive.

- Schema is easily changeable in NoSQL database.

- Built for scale. Horizontal partitioning is in-built in NoSQL database.

- Built for metrics and analysis.

## Disadvantages

- Not built for too many updates (Delete + Insert). Consistency is a problem. ACID is not guranteed.

- Read times are comparitively slower in NoSQL.

- Relations are not implicit in NoSQL.

- Joins are hard in NoSQL. SQL databases to some extent are built for joins.
